# Agent Output Example (Layer 1 - Measurements Only)

**Layer Classification:** Layer 1 (Measurement Agent Output)  
**Generated By:** Agent System via `ReportGenerator.generateRawReport()`  
**Format:** Raw measurements, NO judgments, NO recommendations

---

## ⚠️ What This IS and IS NOT

### ✅ This Document IS:
- **Measurements** of what models found
- **Pattern counts** (how many models agreed)
- **Gap detection** (what some found but others missed)
- **Contradiction flags** (where models disagreed)
- **Coverage metrics** (success/failure rates)

### ❌ This Document IS NOT:
- ~~Severity ratings~~ (e.g., "Critical", "High")
- ~~Recommendations~~ (e.g., "You should fix...")
- ~~Executive summaries~~ with conclusions
- ~~Priority rankings~~
- ~~Quality assessments~~

## Example: Actual Agent Output

```markdown
# Raw Measurement Report: JavaScript Code Audit

---

## Pattern Measurements (Frequency Count)

Patterns = topics mentioned by multiple models

### 1. "sql injection"
- **Mentioned by:** openai, gemini, deepseek
- **Frequency:** 3/3 models
- **Facets:** security
- **Total mentions:** 5

### 2. "memory leak"
- **Mentioned by:** openai, gemini
- **Frequency:** 2/3 models
- **Facets:** performance
- **Total mentions:** 3

### 3. "error handling"
- **Mentioned by:** openai, deepseek
- **Frequency:** 2/3 models  
- **Facets:** quality
- **Total mentions:** 2

---

## Gap Measurements

Gaps = topics some models mentioned but others did not

### security facet

**Topic:** "xss"
- Mentioned by: gemini
- **Gap:** Not mentioned by openai, deepseek

**Topic:** "csrf"
- Mentioned by: deepseek
- **Gap:** Not mentioned by openai, gemini

### performance facet

**Topic:** "n+1"
- Mentioned by: openai
- **Gap:** Not mentioned by gemini, deepseek

---

## Contradiction Measurements

### 1. security facet
- **Type:** no-issues-vs-issues
- **Group A:** openai
- **Group B:** gemini, deepseek

No judgments or suggested actions are included.

## How to Interpret (For Humans - Layer 2)

**When you read Agent output, YOU (human) must:**

1. **Interpret Patterns:**
   - "sql injection mentioned 3/3" → Probably significant
   - "error handling mentioned 2/3" → Moderate agreement

2. **Decide on Gaps:**
   - "XSS mentioned by 1/3" → Should we investigate further?
   - "N+1 mentioned by 1/3" → Is this edge case or missed issue?

3. **Resolve Contradictions:**
   - "1 model says no issues, 2 found issues" → Need human review

4. **Assess Coverage:**
   - "Performance 67% success" → One model failed, results incomplete

**Agent CANNOT do these steps - only humans can.**

## Comparison: Layer 1 vs Layer 2

### Layer 1 (Agent - what we built):
```
Pattern: "sql injection"
Frequency: 3/3 models
Mentioned by: openai, gemini, deepseek
```

### Layer 2 (Human - what we DON'T do):
```
❌ "SQL Injection is CRITICAL and must be fixed immediately"
❌ "Rating: 9/10 security issues"
❌ "Recommendation: Use parameterized queries"
```

## JSON Format (Programmatic Access)

For programmatic use, Agent outputs are also available as structured JSON:

## Where to Find Real Agent Outputs

**In Code:**
- `backend/src/agent/reports/report-generator.js` - Generator logic
- `backend/src/agent/analyzer/response-analyzer.js` - Analysis logic

**In Tests:**
- `backend/src/agent/__tests__/e2e.test.js` - Live example with real API
- `backend/src/agent/__tests__/report-generator.test.js` - Unit tests

**To Generate:**
```javascript
const orchestrator = new AgentOrchestrator();
const result = await orchestrator.executeTask('js-code-audit', code);
console.log(result.results.report.markdown);  // Layer 1 output
```
